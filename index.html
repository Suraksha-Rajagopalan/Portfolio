From a young age, my passion for computer science ignited a relentless curiosity for 
coding and a voracious appetite for learning. My focal point of interest has perpetually 
revolved around the captivating realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine 
Learning.
</p>
<p>
The curriculum of my Electronics and Computer Engineering program at Amrita University
 is a testament to its unique and well-structured nature. It offers an array of 
 fascinating courses, such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Electronics,
  which have captivated my interest and spurred my desire to delve deeper into these 
  topics.
  </p>
<p>
One noteworthy milestone in my journey was a group project I undertook related to IoT, 
specifically focused on home automation. Utilizing the Tinkercad Simulator, our team 
developed a comprehensive solution that showcased the practical applications of IoT in 
enhancing everyday living. This experience was instrumental in consolidating my 
theoretical knowledge with hands-on practical skills.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, I have recently embarked on a web development course, further augmenting 
my proficiency in this domain. This course complements my AI journey by equipping me 
with a broader skill set that encompasses both AI and web development, affording me a 
versatile toolkit for future endeavors.
</p>
<p>
In summation, my journey as a computer science enthusiast has been enriched by the 
diverse range of courses offered by the Electronics and Computer Engineering program 
at Amrita University and my foray into IoT project work. These experiences have 
collectively fueled my passion for AI and Machine Learning while equipping me with the 
skills and knowledge necessary to contribute meaningfully to the field in the future.

<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
    <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/Suraksha-Rajagopalan/Frequency-Controlled-Automatic-Door-Lock">Frequency Controlled Automatic Door Lock</a></h4>
        Mar. 2023 - Jul. 2023<br />
        In this project we have tried to replicate the
        action of an automated door lock system with
        the help of frequency
    </li>
    <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/Suraksha-Rajagopalan/Dyslexia">Detection of Dyslexia in school going children,
        Smart India Hackathon (SIH22)</a></h4>
        Mar. 2022 - Aug. 2022<br />
Our team employed a decision tree classifier as
a fundamental component of our methodology
for the classification of dyslexia in children. This
classification process was contingent upon the
evaluation of several key domains, namely
speaking, listening, writing, and memory. By
conducting assessments and tests within these
areas, we aimed to ascertain the presence or
absence of dyslexia in the child subjects.
    </li>
    <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/Suraksha-Rajagopalan/HomeAutomation_Proteus"> Automation Using Proteus</a></h4>
        Jul. 2023<br />
        In this project we have built on a Home
        Automation System using Proteus. Here we have
        built a Password Protected Door Lock System and
        Temperature Controlled DC Fan.
